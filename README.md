# Click: A Unified College Social Media & Collaboration Platform

**Click** empowers college students to connect, share knowledge, and thrive in their academic and extracurricular journeys. It seamlessly integrates essential features typically found across disparate platforms like Reddit, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Google Forms, offering a convenient and centralized solution.

This project was created for the [Ingenius hackathon 2024](https://www.instagram.com/ingeniushackathon/) where Click was shortlisted as one of the top 11 teams out of 56 participating teams.

## Key Features:

- **Streamlined Communication:**
  - **Posts:** Reach a wide audience and spark discussions on topics relevant to college life. Unlike text-based platforms where messages can get buried, Click's post structure ensures greater visibility.
  - **Real-time Chat:** Engage in instant conversations with classmates, group members, or mentors.
- **Collaborative Project Management:**\
Showcase ongoing projects, connect with like-minded individuals, and collaborate on larger initiatives. Click fosters collaboration and fosters innovation.
- **Comprehensive Club Information:**\
  Discover and explore active clubs on campus. Gain access to detailed descriptions, contact information, and events, streamlining club involvement.
- **College Life Resources:**\
  Access valuable information for first-year students, including insights into college events, GPA management, and attendance tracking. Click empowers freshmen to navigate college with ease.
- **Event Management:**\
   Stay up-to-date on upcoming campus events. Easily register and participate with streamlined registration processes.       Click simplifies event discovery and participation.
